Selenium script to liberate all amrita students out there from wasting hours on filling feedback forms!
This script (kinda) works
Chrome Driver, python and selenium is required to run this script

This script gets list of all urls for each forms and fills them up one by one by choosing random options, it doesn't work for certain radio buttons, feel free to look into it and maybe contribute xD.
